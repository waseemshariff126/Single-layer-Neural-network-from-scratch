Part 1 : Design of Neural Network with proper implementation of forward and backward propagation.

Part 2 : Neural network to read small dataset, train on the network and test on the validation set.

Part 3 : Neural network to read big CIFAR dataset , train on the part 1 network, and give the classification of "Bird and Automobile"
